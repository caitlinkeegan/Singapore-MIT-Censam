# Singapore-MIT-Censam
This repository contains code that I wrote during my time at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, for the purpose of creating graphs and other visuals to analyze climate data.

** for many of these the source file needs to be changed manually 

For Spartan Data:
.csv files for chemicals:
Bandung over 33, Bandung over 33, PM25_Hanoi, Singapore over 21, Singapore under 21, Manila over 20, Manila under 20, cleaned dates for Bandung, a bit of cleaning pm2.5 dates (dates in a format where they can be converted to datetime)

code:
making 4 graphs SPARTAN, plotting all SPARTAN, single scatter plot SPARTAN, python for pie charts, plot for pm2.5 abs and conc (combines with the cleaned datetime dates and plots), SPARTAN prints summary stats 

.csv files for speciation:
Speciation Bandung over limit, speciation Bandung under limit, speciation Manila over limit, speciation Manila under limit, speciation Singapore over limit, speciation Singapore under limit, speciation PM_25 Hanoi

code:
python for speciation of PM 2.5

For NOAA Data:
Final frame, Clean NOAA 50 Stations, Clean and graph NOAA CO File, NOAA Data Frame Monthly Avg, python test for Phnom Penh (format used in Clean NOAA 50 Stations to make Final Frame)



For WMO Data:
jupyter notebook for tanah rata graphs (makes 1 graph and can be altered), successful code for making a plot (all iterations, need to manipulate a little for individual cases because code also cleans the dataframe)
