# Singapore-MIT-Censam
This repository contains code that I wrote during my time at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, for the purpose of creating graphs and other visuals to analyze climate data.


For Spartan Data:
.csv files for chemicals:
Bandung over 33, Bandung over 33, PM25_Hanoi, Singapore over 21, Singapore under 21, Manila over 20, Manila under 20

code:
making 4 graphs SPARTAN, plotting all SPARTAN, single scatter plot SPARTAN, python for pie charts

.csv files for speciation:
Speciation Bandung over limit, speciation Bandung under limit, speciation Manila over limit, speciation Manila under limit, speciation Singapore over limit, speciation Singapore under limit, speciation PM_25 Hanoi

code:
python for speciation of PM 2.5

For NOAA Data:
Final frame, Clean NOAA 50 Stations, Clean and graph NOAA CO File, NOAA Data Frame Monthly Avg
